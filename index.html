  <p class="ex1"><pre>
              This article presents the crucial role of artificial heart valves in the restoration of cardiac
              function and the engineering considerations behind valve replacements. The focus being on
              design principles, valve mechanics and material selection. Mechanical valves, particularly
              bileaflet designs, made from pyrolytic carbon, offering extreme durability and should last the
              patients whole life, however they have to be on anticoagulation medication for life. In contrast,
              tissue valves last for only a few years due to the decreased longevity due to structural valve
              degeneration and stenosis. Comparing the performance, advantages and disadvantages of
              each type of valve type. This also explores the ongoing engineering challenges with improving
              the physiological performance of artificial heart valves.

<h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1" id="Introduction"><pre>
              Artificial heart valves over the many years in which they have been developed have caused
              many patients who have undergone surgery to have their heart valves replaced to have a great
              increase in quality of life as well as a longer lifespan. In 2020 alone, the total number of heart
              valve surgeries performed reached an approximate 25,000 patients, a third less than during the
              same period of time in 2019, enough people to fill the O2 arena. The new valves in a patient’s
              heart should last a lifetime due to the design at which they are manufactured, made from
              materials such as pyrolytic carbon, titanium and other metals or other tissues to ensure
              minimal mechanical fatigue and maximum longevity in which this article will cover.
  </pre></p>

<h3 id="Valve-Mechanics">Valve Mechanics and Design Principles</h3>
  <p class="ex1" id="Valve-Mechanics-and-Design-Principles"><pre>
              Heart valves are designed to allow blood flow whilst preventing back flow under different
              pressure conditions. When chambers contract the pressure increases inside them and
              therefore force the valve open where blood is then pumped into the rest of the heart or body,
              when the chambers relax it causes a negative pressure difference and so shuts the heart valve.
              The Mechanical design of an artificial valve is therefore critical to achieving the same efficient
              hemodynamics and long-term reliability. 
  
              There are 2 types of artificial heart valves: Mechanical and Tissue. Mechanical valves where the
              main advantage is due to their durability as “these valves rarely require replacement and often
              last for the remainder of a patient’s life” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.19936">(Frankel and Nguyen,2021)</a> with the disadvantage that
              the patient will have to be prescribed life-long anticoagulation medication (blood thinners) due
              to the possibility of blood clotting and blocking the leaflets from opening. There are many valves
              such as bileaflet and trileaflet designs that are used in practice where, bileaflet tends to be
              used more commonly whereas trileaflet designs are less commonly used and mimic the natural 
              mechanics of a valve. The bileaflet design creates areas with more uniform central flow and has
              much better hemodynamics as compared to previous evolutions of heart valves such as ball-and-cage.

              <font size="2">Figure 1: Example mechanical valves from a variety of major manufactures (Arash Kheradvar, 2019)</font>
    
              “The first of these valves, a St. Jude Medical cardiac valve prosthesis, showed favourable results
              for AVR, mitral valve replacement (MVR), and double valve replacement (DVR) with “no cases of 
              mechanical failure”. With these advantages, a rigid bileaflet valve is the most common
              mechanical valve design used today.” (Principles of Heart Valve Engineering, 2019)
  </pre></p>

<h3 id="Materials">Materials Selection</h3>
  <p class="ex1" id="Materials-Selection"><pre>
              However, no matter the design, the material at which the valve is made from is a main factor
              and consideration to think about as it must be made from a stiff material to resist deformation.
              One of the most common materials used for mechanical heart valves is pyrolytic carbon where
              according to a review article of the Mechanical considerations for polymeric heart valve
              development:
  
              “Pyrolytic carbon is strong and quite resistant to abrasion and fatigue. Wear testing of St. Judes
              Medical mechanical valves has predicted that the pyrolytic carbon coating on the valves could
              last well over 200 years. Clinically, bileaflet mechanical valves have demonstrated durability
              beyond 20 years, with low rates of valve-related mortality” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119493">(Li et al., 2019).</a>
  
  
              Historically, these mechanical valves have been the favoured of the two types for younger
              patients due to their longevity, however for older aged patients “the American College of
              Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend mechanical valves for people
              under age 50 and biologic (tissue) valves for those over 70.”<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/valve-replacement-mechanical-or-tissue">(Harvard Health Publishing, 2018).</a>
              This is due to the tissue valve’s longevity being much less than mechanical valves. 
  
              Tissue valves/Bioprosthetic valves (BHVs) are “constructed from porcine valve or bovine
              pericardial tissue. The geometry and mechanical properties of animal valves are similar to 
              those of humans.” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119493">(Li et al., 2019).</a>
  
              Bioprosthetic valves have a shorter lifespan due to “structural valve degeneration (SVD)” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119493">(Li et al., 2019).</a>
              This develops in multiple stages, from stage 1-3. A valve is classed as stage 1 when
              there is “morphological leaflet abnormality [without] hemodynamic change.” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shj.2022.100155">(Patel et al., 2023)</a>
              where, if not attended to can lead to stage 3 of SVD, his is classed as severe SVD: 
  
              “SVD Stage 3 - severe stenosis and/or regurgitation
            	    • Mean gradient ≥40 mmHg
                  • Mean gradient ≥20 mmHg increase from baseline concomitant with dec. in EOA and
                    DVI
                  • Severe AR (>2+, 4+) new or worsened” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shj.2022.100155">(Patel et al., 2023)</a>
  
              Stenosis, in this context, is the abnormal narrowing of the heart canals which restricts the flow
              of blood as there is a resistance to flow which causes a pressure difference between the
              chamber before the valve and the chamber after it.

<h3 id="Advancements">Future Advancements</h3>
  <p class="ex1" id="Future-Advancments"><pre>
             Currently valve replacement is the only solution to treat patients suffering from valvular heart
             disease, however the future of heart valves is heading to use tissue-engineering to try and find a
             solution for the surgical procedure using minimally invasive techniques. There has been much
             research where: “Situ heart valve tissue engineering based on cell-free functionalized starter
             materials is considered to be a promising approach for clinical translation” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/term.2326">(Fioretta et al., 2018)</a> 
  </pre></p>

<h3 id="Conclude">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1" id="Conclusion"><pre>
             Artificial heart valves have become a major advancement in biomechanical engineering by 
             many trials and improvement of combing precise mechanical design with durable materials to 
             try mimic the natural flow of blood and valve functions. Both tissue and mechanical valves both 
             have their pros and cons; mechanical valves require the patient to permanently have to take 
             anticoagulation medication for the rest of their life with the upside that their life and quality of 
             life is greatly increased whilst tissue has a shorter longevity however allows the patient to go 
             back to normality. Hopefully future of heart valves is able to combine the best of both allowing 
             patients to have the durability of a mechanical valve and the performance and hemodynamics 
             of a tissue valve.
