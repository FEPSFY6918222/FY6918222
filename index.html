            This article presents the crucial role of artificial heart valves in the restoration of cardiac
            function and the engineering considerations behind valve replacements. The focus being on
            design principles, valve mechanics and material selection. Mechanical valves, particularly
            bileaflet designs, made from pyrolytic carbon, offering extreme durability and should last the
            patients whole life, however they have to be on anticoagulation medication for life. In contrast,
            tissue valves last for only a few years due to the decreased longevity due to structural valve
            degeneration and stenosis. Comparing the performance, advantages and disadvantages of
            each type of valve type. This also explores the ongoing engineering challenges with improving
            the physiological performance of artificial heart valves.

            Artificial heart valves over the many years in which they have been developed have caused
        many patients who have undergone surgery to have their heart valves replaced to have a great
        increase in quality of life as well as a longer lifespan. In 2020 alone, the total number of heart
        valve surgeries performed reached an approximate 25,000 patients, a third less than during the
        same period of time in 2019, enough people to fill the O2 arena. The new valves in a patient’s
        heart should last a lifetime due to the design at which they are manufactured, made from
        materials such as pyrolytic carbon, titanium and other metals or other tissues to ensure
        minimal mechanical fatigue and maximum longevity in which this article will cover.

  <h4 id="Valve Mechanics and Design Principles">Valve Mechanics and Design Principles</h4>
    <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
        Heart valves are designed to allow blood flow whilst preventing back flow under different
        pressure conditions. When chambers contract the pressure increases inside them and
        therefore force the valve open where blood is then pumped into the rest of the heart or body,
        when the chambers relax it causes a negative pressure difference and so shuts the heart valve.
        The Mechanical design of an artificial valve is therefore critical to achieving the same efficient
        hemodynamics and long-term reliability. 
        
        There are 2 types of artificial heart valves: Mechanical and Tissue. Mechanical valves where the
        main advantage is due to their durability as “these valves rarely require replacement and often
        last for the remainder of a patient’s life” (Frankel and Nguyen,2021) with the disadvantage that
        the patient will have to be prescribed life-long anticoagulation medication (blood thinners) due
        to the possibility of blood clotting and blocking the leaflets from opening. There are many valves
        such as bileaflet and trileaflet designs that are used in practice where, bileaflet tends to be
        used more commonly whereas trileaflet designs are less commonly used and mimic the natural 
        mechanics of a valve. The bileaflet design creates areas with more uniform central flow and has
        much better hemodynamics as compared to previous evolutions of heart valves such as ball-and-cage. 
        
        “The first of these valves, a St. Jude Medical cardiac valve prosthesis, showed favourable results
        for AVR, mitral valve replacement (MVR), and double valve replacement (DVR) with “no cases of 
        mechanical failure”. With these advantages, a rigid bileaflet valve is the most common
        mechanical valve design used today.” (Principles of Heart Valve Engineering, 2019)

        However, no matter the design, the material at which the valve is made from is a main factor
        and consideration to think about as it must be made from a stiff material to resist deformation.
        One of the most common materials used for mechanical heart valves is pyrolytic carbon where
        according to a review article of the Mechanical considerations for polymeric heart valve
        development:
        
        “Pyrolytic carbon is strong and quite resistant to abrasion and fatigue. Wear testing of St. Judes
        Medical mechanical valves has predicted that the pyrolytic carbon coating on the valves could
        last well over 200 years. Clinically, bileaflet mechanical valves have demonstrated durability
        beyond 20 years, with low rates of valve- related mortality” (Li et al., 2019).

        Historically, these mechanical valves have been the favoured of the two types for younger
        patients due to their longevity, however for older aged patients “the American College of
        Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend mechanical valves for people
        under age 50 and biologic (tissue) valves for those over 70.” (Harvard Health Publishing, 2018).
        This is due to the tissue valve’s longevity being much less than mechanical valves. 
        
        Tissue valves/Bioprosthetic valves (BHVs) are “constructed from porcine valve or bovine
        pericardial tissue. The geometry and mechanical properties of animal valves are similar to 
        those of humans.” (Li et al., 2019).  

        Bioprosthetic valves have a shorter lifespan due to “structural valve degeneration (SVD)” (Li et al., 2019).
        This develops in multiple stages, from stage 1-3. A valve is classed as stage 1 when
        there is “morphological leaflet abnormality [without] hemodynamic change.” (Patel et al., 2023)
        where, if not attended to can lead to stage 3 of SVD, his is classed as severe SVD: 
        
        “SVD Stage 3 - severe stenosis and/or regurgitation
      	    • Mean gradient ≥40 mmHg
            • Mean gradient ≥20 mmHg increase from baseline concomitant with dec. in EOA and
              DVI
            • Severe AR (>2+, 4+) new or worsened” (Patel et al., 2023)
        
        Stenosis, in this context, is the abnormal narrowing of the heart canals which restricts the flow
        of blood as there is a resistance to flow which causes a pressure difference between the
        chamber before the valve and the chamber after it.
